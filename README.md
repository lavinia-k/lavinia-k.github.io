### I am excited by the opportunity to develop others and help them succeed.

I enjoy taking the time to get to know others - who they are, their passions, their future goals - both personally and professionally. I like identifying their strengths, their potential, and areas for growth. I like supporting, guiding and encouraging them to pursue actions or making decisions that will help them lead happier lives, advance their career, or form stronger relationships. I try to stay aware of what is current for them, because other things happening in your life will definitely affect the way you work and feel.

### I have the ability to establish relationships and work with other business teams effectively (support, marketing, legal, etc.).

I like having insight into the bigger picture connections between business teams and their day-to-day work, because I think thatâ€™s where a lot of untapped opportunity tends to lie - collaborations, ideas, needs that can be solved, pain points that no one has become aware of yet. I believe that organisations should function as a whole - and that teams, roles and job titles should not get in the way of finding the best solution or approach to a problem that might be overcome with a little cross-team flexibility or creativity.

### I have a history of being respected by my colleagues above, below and side-by-side, and I work effectively as part of a team.

I have had peers, managers and juniors alike seek my advice across my career. I support and advise colleagues both at my level and well above it from time-to-time, acting as a sounding board, encouraging peers to tap into new areas they may not have focused on or considered before, and provide a valuable third-party perspective on different situations and their potential impact as well as remediation strategies.
